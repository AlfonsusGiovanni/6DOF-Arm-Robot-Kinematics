# 6-DOF Arm Robot Kinematics

This project is created to help intermediate to amateur robotics developers to understand more about kinematics in 6-DOF robot arm. There is a python tkinter based app to give an input (Angle or Position) to the STM32F401CCU6 microcontroler that I used in this project. All the mathematical calculation is done by the STM32, it can helps when you want to directly simulate it with actuator like stepper or servo motors.
